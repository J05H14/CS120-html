			<caption>
				Easy step-by-step picture for how to cut a whole chicken into pieces for frying, stock, or baking.
				Buying whole chickens is far cheaper than buying them pre-carved. So save yourself some serious
				cash and take pride in learning how to break down your own poultry.  The added benefit is having
				an endless supply of home-made chicken stock from all of the left over pieces!
