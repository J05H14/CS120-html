			<h2>What is It</h2>
		</div>
		
		<p class = "special">
			Cake is a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked. In its oldest forms, 
			cakes were modifications of breads but now cover a wide range of preparations 
			that can be simple or elaborate and share features with other desserts such as 
			pastries, meringues, custards and pies.
		</p>

		<div>
			<p class = "special">
				Typical cake ingredients are flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, a liquid, and 
				leavening agents, such as baking soda and/or baking powder. Common additional 
				ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, 
				and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary 
				ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces 
				(like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with
				marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.

			Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, for example 
			weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some 
			are bread-like, some rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making
			is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went 
			into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and 
			directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake.
