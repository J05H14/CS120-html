			George Washington was the first President of the United States 
			(1789–97), the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during
			the American Revolutionary War, and one of the Founding Fathers of
			the United States. He presided over the convention that drafted the 
			current United States Constitution and during his lifetime was called
			the "father of his country".
		</p>
		<p class = "body">
			Widely admired for his strong leadership qualities, Washington was 
			unanimously elected president in the first two national elections. 
			He oversaw the creation of a strong, well-financed national 
			government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary 
			Wars, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and won acceptance among 
			Americans of all types. Washington's incumbency established many
			precedents, still in use today, such as the cabinet system, the 
			inaugural address, and the title Mr. President. His retirement
			from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until
			1940, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term.
			The 22nd Amendment (1951) now limits the president to eight years 
			in office.

				Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which 
				devised a new form of federal government for the United States. 
				Following unanimous election as president in 1789, he worked to unify
				rival factions in the fledgling nation. He supported Alexander Hamilton's
				programs to satisfy all debts, federal and state, established a permanent
				seat of government, implemented an effective tax system, and created a 
				national bank. In avoiding war with Great Britain, he guaranteed a 
				decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795,
				despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians. Although he remained 
				nonpartisan, never joining the Federalist Party, he largely supported its 
				policies. Washington's Farewell Address was an influential primer on 
				republican virtue, warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and 
				involvement in foreign wars. He retired from the presidency in 1797, 
				returning to his home and plantation at Mount Vernon.
