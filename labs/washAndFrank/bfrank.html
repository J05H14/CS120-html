			Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, 
			politician, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, civic 
			activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major

				He played a major role in establishing the University of 
				Pennsylvania and was elected the first president of the 
				American Philosophical Society. Franklin became a national 
				hero in America when as agent for several colonies he 
				spearheaded the effort to have Parliament in London repeal 
				the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was 
				widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris 
				and was a major figure in the development of positive 
				Franco-American relations. His efforts to secure support for 
				the American Revolution by shipments of crucial munitions proved 
				vital for the American war effort.
